Part 1, HTMLCSS of the grand scheme of the site. 


- Added Styling (flex-box etc.), HTML and images to satisfy the requirements of the first HTML/CSS assignment.
- Future? Implement interactivity, such as navigation across the site and other associated sites, and a tool to help players identify ghosts.
    - Add difficulty modifier for evidences. If you toggle one evidence then remove the impossible ghosts with chosen evidences).
- Additionally, an easier thing to implement, to make separate lightning modes, one original, dark mode and light mode. (3 separate CSS maybe and use a JavaScript toggle between each of those?
    - Should also have some form of remember the settings from last time using the website.
