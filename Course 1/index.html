    <h1 class="header">Phasmophobia Evidences to Identify Ghosts</h1>
    <p>Are you eager to learn the secrets of identifying the many ghosts in the game?</p>
    <p>With this guide, we will show you how to do just that!</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>Let's get used to the large variety of tools available in the game.</p>
    <p>Depending on the difficulty, each ghost have from 3-4 evidences to only 1-2 evidences (the additional evidence is the lying "Mimic"-ghost).</p>

    <!-- EMF Section -->

            <h3>The EMF</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="emf.html">EMF</a> 
                <img class="intextImg" src="img/EMF_Tier1.webp" alt="The EMF from Phasmophobia">
                is perhaps the most notorious tool in the game, used to measure the levels of radioactivity. 
                It is a great tool to make sure you are in the ghost room and to identify the ghost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ghosts that have <a href="">EMF</a> level 5 as an evidence:
                <br><em>
                    Spirit<br>
                    Wraith<br>

                    Shade<br>

            <h3>The Ultraviolet Flashlight</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="uv.html">ultraviolet flashlight</a>
                <img src="img/Fingerprints_3.webp" alt="Ectoplasmic fingerprints." class="intextImg">
                is used to spot fingerprints. It is excellent for spotting ectoplasmic fingerprints or footprints left by the ghost. 
                Obake, one of the notorious ghosts, has a special interaction with the ultraviolet flashlight, 
                sometimes showing a unique handprint with six fingers or a seriously twisted foot. Ghosts that have <a href="">ultraviolet:</a>  <br>
                <em>Phantom <br>Poltergeist <br>Banshee <br> Jinn <br> Demon <br> Hantu <br> Goryo <br> Myling <br> Obake <br> The Mimic</em>

            <h3>Ghost Writing</h3>
            <p>The <a href="ghostwrite.html">Ghost Writing</a><img src="img/WritingBookT2.webp" alt="A ghost writing book" class="intextImg"> is used to identify ghosts with ghost writing as an evidence. If there are written stuff on a book, it is indicating that the ghost is a ghostwriter (pun intended). Ghosts that have <a href="">Ghost Writing</a> as an evidence are: <br><em>Spirit <br> Poltergeist <br>Mare <br> Revenant <br> Shade <br> Demon <br> Myling <br> Moroi <br> Deogen <br> Thaye</em></p>

            <h3>Freezing Temperatures</h3>
            <p>The <a href="freezing_temps.html">Freezing Temperature</a><img src="img/Thermometer_Render.webp" alt="A thermometer" class="intextImg"> identifies ghosts that have freezing as their evidence. If the temperatures are below 1 degree Celsius it's freezing (Game is American maybe, so they probably don't know the actual freezing point should be 0.) Ghosts that have  <a href="">freezing temperatures</a> are as following: <br><em>Jinn <br>Revenant <br>Shade <br>Demon <br> Yurei <br> Oni <br> Hantu <br> Onryo <br> The Twins <br> The Mimic <br> Moroi</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item-img">
            <img src="img/Thermometer_Render.webp" alt="A thermometer" id="rightImg">
            <p>This is a tool used to see how warm the area around you is. Is it cold? Then you have likely found the ghost room!</p>

        <div class="flex-item-text">
            <h3>D.O.T.S</h3>
            <p>The <a href="dots.html">D.O.T.S Projector</a><img src="img/DOTS_T2.webp" alt="D.O.T.S projector" class="intextImg">is a device that can show movement in ghosts, allowing the players to eventually see a ghost model if the projector is aimed at the area where the ghost is. The Goryo cannot be seen through in-person projection, so one must use a camera (which is highlighted in the coming section. The ghosts that have <a href="">D.O.T.S</a> as an evidence are: <br><em>Wraith <br>Phantom <br> Banshee <br>Yurei <br>Oni <br> Yokay <br>Goryo <b>(with camera)</b> <br>Raiju <br>Deogen <br> Thaye</em></p>

            <img src="img/DOTS_T2.webp" alt="DOTS Projector" id="rightImg">
            <p>This is a green dots light that can show ghost models.  </p>

        <div class="flex-item-text">
            <h3>Ghost Orbs</h3>
            <p>The <a href="ghost_orb.html">Ghost Orbs</a> can be seen with a video camera <img src="img/VideoCamera090_T1.webp" alt="A video camera" class="intextImg">. The orbs are orbs that have a snowfall like animation and are often the giveaway of a ghost room if the ghost has ghost orb as an evidence. The Mimic is a liar, and will always have ghost orb as an evidence even when he does not explicitly have it as an evidence. The ghosts that have <a href="">Ghost Orbs</a> are as following: <br> <em>Banshee <br> Mare <br> Revenant <br> Yurei <br> Yokai <br> Hantu <br> Onryo <br> Raiju <br> Obake <br> The Mimic <b style="color:red;">LIAR</b> <br> Thaye</em></p>

        <div class="flex-item-img">
            <img src="img/Ghost_Orb_video_feed_0.4.0.webp" alt="A video feed of ghost orb happening" id="rightImg" style="max-width: 650px;"> <!--Increased size for viewability. Will improve the view on mobile at a later point, but it works! But for actual use, I think there is room for improvement.-->
            <p>Does ghost orb show in the video feed? See closely!</p>

        <div class="flex-item-text">
            <h3>Spirit Box</h3>
            <p>The <a href="spiritbox.html">Spirit Box</a> <img src="img/SpiritBox090_T2.webp" alt="The Spirit Box" class="intextImg"> is a type of evidence that interacts with the microphone, allowing you to talk to the ghost with common phrases like "Are you friendly?", "How many have you killed?", "Where are you?" and other phrases to converse with the ghost. If the ghost speaks back, it's a spirit-boxing ghost. The following ghosts have <a href="">Spirit Box</a> as an evidence: <br><em>Spirit <br> Wraith <br>Phantom <br> Poltergeist <br>Mare <br>Yokai <br>Onryo <br>The Twins <br>The Mimic <br>Moroi <br>Deogen</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item-img">
            <img src="img/SpiritBox090_T2.webp" alt="The Spirit Box" id="rightImg">
            <p>Use this to talk to the ghost!</p>
